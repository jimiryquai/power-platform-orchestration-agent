# Archived Session Notes

## Historical Project Context

This file contains archived session notes and project history that has been superseded by the new AI productivity system but may contain valuable context for future development.

## Session History Summary

### Phase 1: Initial Architecture Development
- Implemented Azure DevOps integration with MCP client
- Created S-Project template with 12-week structure
- Established basic configuration management

### Phase 2: Architecture Pivot
- **Major Decision**: Eliminated n8n dependency
- Moved to MCP-only conversational architecture
- Updated PRD to reflect simplified approach

### Phase 3: Technical Implementation
- Fixed Azure DevOps API integration (400 Bad Request resolved)
- Validated authentication with PAT tokens
- Established working project creation workflow

### Phase 4: Documentation & Optimization
- Created comprehensive AI productivity system
- Established three-folder structure (ai_docs, specs, .claude)
- Consolidated knowledge for improved AI development efficiency

## Key Blockers Resolved
1. **Azure DevOps Payload Validation** - Fixed through proper JSON structure
2. **Authentication Strategy** - Established Service Principal approach
3. **Architecture Complexity** - Simplified through n8n elimination

## Environment Setup Evolution
- Started with PAC CLI integration
- Moved to direct REST API integration
- Established test environment at `https://james-dev.crm11.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2`

## File Structure Evolution
```
Original Structure → Simplified Structure
├── Complex n8n workflows → Direct MCP integration
├── PAC CLI dependencies → REST API calls
├── Multiple config files → Unified configuration
└── Scattered docs → Organized ai_docs system
```

## Success Patterns Identified
- **Direct API integration** more reliable than CLI wrappers
- **MCP servers** provide better modularity
- **Conversational interface** superior to complex workflow engines
- **TypeScript migration** improves code quality significantly

## Lessons Learned
- Start with simplest architecture that works
- Eliminate dependencies that don't add clear value
- Prioritize developer experience and debugging capability
- Maintain clear separation between integration layers
